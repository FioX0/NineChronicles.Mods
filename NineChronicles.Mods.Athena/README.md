# Athena

Athena allows players to customize and strategically augment their gear, and gives them the ability to use that gear to virtually simulate different battles.

## Key Features

- Custom Equipment Crafting: Athena enables players to craft and modify any equipment in the game. Tailor the stats and options of your gear to suit your specific gameplay needs.
- Battle Simulation: Test your gear against challenging stages and arena opponents. This functionality allows for extensive experimentation with different strategies, helping you determine the most effective equipment configurations to advance in the game.

## Install and Run

We'll use Athena Mod as an example to illustrate the installation and launch process.

### Installation: Windows

1. Download the latest version of Athena Mod from [GitHub release](https://github.com/planetarium/NineChronicles.Mods/releases): `Athena-x.y.z.zip`.
2. Press the `Windows + R` keys simultaneously to open the Run dialog box, type `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Nine Chronicles\player\main` and press `Enter`.
3. In the folder that opens, unzip the downloaded file and paste the contents inside the `Athena-x.y.z` folder.

### Run

Launching the game and pressing the `Space` key after the loading screen.

> [!TIP]
> If the game does not run normally or the mod does not activate, double-check the installation process and make sure all files are in the correct locations.
